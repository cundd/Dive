[Dive](http://dive.cundd.net/) - The surround screening VJ software
===================================================================

"Dive is the most advanced multi-screen VJ-solution, specially optimized for surround screening in live environments such as parties, clubs and discotheques. It uses state of the art computing technologies such as OpenGL and Grand Central Dispatch. A huge effect library comes right out of the box, all controllable via MIDI or Automation.
The Dive Suite includes the main Dive application for full control and the client application Dice for remote playback over a network. All mixing, selection of prepared or live material, as well as the application of effects and filters, is done through the main software. Dice, the client part of the suite, then establishes a connection to the main application and synchronizes the current settings in realtime to render the video to one of the multiple screens."
Unfortunately the text above describes a VJ system that's currently not (fully) realized. The system, its current state of development and the thesis are the product of the bachelor thesis of Daniel Corn, created in 2010 at the University of Applied Sciences in Vorarlberg, Austria.
